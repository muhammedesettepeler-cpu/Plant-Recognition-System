## 📝 Development Notes

### Backend API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/v1/health` - Health check
- `GET /api/v1/status` - Detailed status
- `POST /api/v1/chat` - Text chat
- `POST /api/v1/chat-with-image` - Image recognition with chat
- `GET /api/v1/conversation-history/{session_id}` - Chat history

### Environment Setup
- Backend proxy configured in package.json: `"proxy": "http://localhost:8000"`
- Backend must be running on port 8000
- Redis must be running for rate limiting
- Weaviate connection required for similarity search

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Run `npm install` and test the application
   ```powershell
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test all features** with backend running:
   - Start backend: `cd backend && python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
   - Start Redis: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.redis.yml up -d`
   - Test all pages and features

3. **Fix any bugs** found during testing

4. **Optional**: Add enhancements from the list above

5. **Deploy**: Build production version
   ```powershell
   npm run build
   ```

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check backend is running on port 8000
2. Check Redis is running
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify proxy configuration in package.json
5. Clear browser cache and restart
